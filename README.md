1)A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards. Given a palindrome write a program to print the sorted list of all palindromes that can be constructed from the alphabets of the given palindrome. All palindromes should start in a newline.

Input Format :

The first line, an integer T, indicating the number of test cases T lines each containing one string (palindrome)

Output Format :

Print sorted list of all palindromes constructed from the given palindrome of the ith test case . If the entered string is not a palindrome, then it should print as Not a palindrome.

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

1

NITIN

Sample Output:

INTNI

NITIN

Explanation:

There are only two palindromes that can be constructed from NITIN.
